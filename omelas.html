      “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas” presents a familiar ethical dilemma. This utilitarian dilemma asks if perfect happiness and freedom from suffering for many is worth the maximal suffering of one. According to utilitarian philosophy, the answer is usually yes. The author, Ursula K. Le Guin, is challenging that philosophy through this short story. I’m finding difficulty deciding on the question she presents.
