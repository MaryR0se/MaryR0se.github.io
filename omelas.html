        “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas” presents a familiar ethical dilemma. This utilitarian dilemma asks if perfect happiness and freedom from suffering for many is worth the maximal suffering of one. According to utilitarian philosophy, the answer is usually yes. The author, Ursula K. Le Guin, is challenging that philosophy through this short story. I’m finding difficulty deciding on the question she presents.

      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Utilitarianism takes a mathematical approach to ethics. In comparing the ethical merit of multiple choices, each choice is scored by the happiness it causes minus the suffering it causes. A choice with a higher score is considered more favorable in utilitarian philosophy. As a hypothetical example, suppose a student has the choice to use a rare free hour to either write a response paper assigned in her Data Ethics class or play Minecraft. The choice to write the paper causes suffering due to low stimulation for a period of one hour, but it also leads to happiness in the pride and relief she feels later for having turned it in before it’s due and now being able to dedicate her afternoon to more enjoyable things. Subtracting moderate, short-lived suffering from moderate, longer-lived happiness yields a positive subjective score. The choice to instead play Minecraft causes an hour of happiness due to Minecraft being very fun and stimulating, but it causes the long-term stress of still having the task on her to-do list, missing the deadline, and increasing later work loads when she’s assigned additional homework. Subtracting intense, longer-lived suffering from intense, short-lived happiness yields a negative subjective score. The obvious choice here is to write the paper. However, not every ethical decision has a utilitarian solution that aligns with its solutions from other ways of thinking. These examples can bring into question how universally applicable utilitarian judgment actually is.

      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Le Guine presents one such example. The story of the city of Omelas operates under the assumption of some unexplained magic that allows minimal suffering and maximal happiness to the entire population of Omelas, excepting one, in exchange for the maximal suffering and minimal happiness of that one. Omelas is illustrated as an ideal sort of utopia until the reader learns that this perfection is magically thanks to a unanimous agreement to lock one child in solitary confinement. This is about all the information we have from which to calculate a utilitarian ethical merit score for the scenario.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Suppose Omelas has a population of 
        \(n\)
        citizens (a natural number). The exact population of Omelas is not specified. Since it’s implied in the story, let’s assume the population is significantly greater than some small natural number like ten. Suppose 
        \(n-1\)
        citizens of Omelas have a happiness score
        \(h_{citizens}\),
        which we assume is very high, and a suffering score 
        \(d_{citizens}\),
        which we assume is very low. Suppose one child has a happiness score 
        \(h_{child}\),
        which we assume is very low, and a suffering score 
        \(d_{child}\)
        which we assume is very high. The net ethical merit score is therefore:
        <center>$$
            (n-1) \cdot ( h_{citizens} - d_{citizens} ) + 1 \cdot ( h_{child} - d_{child} )
        $$</center>
        We can substitute some of the variables for arbitrary high and low numbers to get:
        <center>$$
            (n-1) \cdot ( 100 - 0 ) + 1 \cdot ( 0 - 100 )
        $$</center>
        This simplifies to:
        <center>$$
            100n - 100
        $$</center>
        Since \(n\) is always greater than two, the expressions above will always be positive. Therefore, under utilitarianism, this scenario is a moral net positive.
